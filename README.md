* Angular client-side: The user interface is built using Angular, providing a responsive and intuitive front-end experience. Users can easily navigate through the application, select files for upload, and monitor the upload progress.
* Web API server-side: The server-side of the application is developed using Web API, which provides a robust and scalable infrastructure for handling file uploads and managing Azure storage.
* Layered architecture: The software follows a layered architecture design pattern, promoting separation of concerns and maintainability. The layers include presentation, business logic, and data access, ensuring modularity and code reusability.
 * Azure integration: The software integrates seamlessly with Azure cloud storage, leveraging its powerful features for secure and reliable file storage.
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
